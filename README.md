### Hi there üëã

My name is Roman, I'm a Data Scientist. 

üî≠ I'm currently working on Graph Neural Networks with Economical Graphs.
I both like develop models as a Data Scientist and implement them into Production as an ML Engineer.

üå±  I'm currently lerning the following courses:
 - C++ Developer course with excellets projects like "Mython interpreter" and  "Search engine": https://practicum.yandex.ru/cpp/
 - Computer Vision for Middel Data Scientists: https://deepschool.ru/

**Fields of interests:** Network Science, GNN, NLP, CV, MLOps, C++, HPC, Distributed Systems, Algotrading, AI in Biology

### Skills üõ†Ô∏è

 - **Languages:** Python, C++, SQL, Bash, Java (a long time ago)
 - **DS/DL Modeling:** NLP, CV, GNN, Transformers, OCR, Time Series Analysis, Ranking, Metric Learning
 - **DS/ML Tooling:** PyTorch, DGL, PyG, Huggung Face, PyTorch Lightning, XGBoost/LightGBM/CatBoost, Scikit-Learn, SciPy, Pandas, Pybind11
 - **XOps:** Unix/Linux/AIX, Bash, AWK, Jenkins, Git, Airflow, Docker, Docker Compose, Ansible
 - **HPC/Big Data:** OMP, MPI, Hadoop, PySpark, Hive, Slurm, HDFS
 - **Distributed Learning:** PyTorch Distributed, Gloo, NCCL, Khorovod
