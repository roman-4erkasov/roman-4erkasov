### Hi there 👋

My name is Roman, I'm a Data Scientist and ML Engineer with Python/C/C++ backend. 

🔭 I'm currently working with Graph Neural Networks based on Economical Graphs.
I both like developong models as a Data Scientist and implement them into Production as an ML Engineer.

🌱  I'm currently lerning learning the following courses:
 - C++ Developer course with excellets projects, for example "Mython interpreter": https://practicum.yandex.ru/cpp/
 - Computer Vision for Middel Data Scientists: https://deepschool.ru/
